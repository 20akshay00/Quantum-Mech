### A collection of QM simulations

This repo holds my first coding 'project' and involves the work I did in Summer 2020. Most of the codes are unlikely to be functional since I was unaware of environments and did not note the package versions. Regardless, I will leave them here as a marker for where my journey began. 

#### What do they do?

- Two of the files solve the time-dependent schrodinger equation in 1D, using a [finite-difference](TDSE_CrankNicholson_FINAL.py) and a [pseudo-spectral method](TDSE_SplitOp_1D.py).

- The [third file](Tmatrix_1D_FINAL.py) involves T-matrix calculations to find the scattering co-efficients of a plane-wave incident on a 1D potential, as a function of its incident energy.

The methods used are elaborated in the [report](/report/2020report.pdf).
